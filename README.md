# Uncovering emerging roles, skills, and trends in the ML/AI Job Market

## Description


Using a global dataset of AI-related job postings, this project identifies trends in skill demand, the rise of new roles, and changes across different regions and industries. The goal is to help workers and organizations better understand the evolving AI job marketâ€”supporting professionals in learning the right skills and helping companies plan for future talent needs.

## Structure


The data folder contains all datasets, with raw holding the original data and processed storing cleaned versions. The notebooks folder includes Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and experiments, while the src folder contains the main code organized into preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation sections. The figures folder is used to store visual outputs like graphs, and the docs folder holds additional project documentation. The main directory also has a README.md explaining the project, a .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files, and a requirements.txt listing the needed dependencies.

## Setup instructions


To set up the environment, first install Python and create a virtual environment. Then, install all required dependencies using the requirements.txt file by running pip install -r requirements.txt. This ensures all necessary libraries for data processing, modeling, and visualization are available.
